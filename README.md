When I heard from my teacher that I could do research on a disease and work on using data to predict it, I was thrilled. So I took this chance to practice my Data Science and Machine Learning skills.

I chose HIV for my project as it might have a large impact on my life and hurts many people, even a few that I know and would call friends. As well as it does have a lot of data for it.

Sadly, missing a lot of needed data, my Neural Network was not able to actually make the predictions with the accuracy I wanted.

The full breakdown, results and code is in the Google Colab link below.
